      <a href="https://www.archer2.ac.uk">ARCHER2, the new UK national supercomputing service</a> offers a capability resource for running
      very large parallel jobs. Based around an HPE Cray EX supercomputing system with an estimated peak performance of 28 PFLOP/s, the machine 
			will have 5,848 compute nodes, each with dual AMD EPYC Zen2 (Rome) 64 core CPUs at 2.2GHz, giving 748,544 cores in total. The initial service, which 
			will be live from early 2021, is based on a subset of 4 cabinets of the total 23 cabinet system.  The remaining 19 cabinets will be added later in 2021.
			The service includes
      a service desk staffed by HPC experts from EPCC with support from HPE Cray. Access is free at
      point of use for academic researchers working in the EPSRC and NERC domains. Users will also be able to purchase 
      access at a variety of rates. Industry access will be available.
