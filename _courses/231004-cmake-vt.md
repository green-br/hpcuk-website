It is common on High Performance Computing machines to install software packages from source code. Many packages today make use of CMake, an open-source tool that automates the process of building, testing and packaging software.

We will give an introduction to CMake from the point of view of a user attempting to install a CMake package. We will cover configuring, building and installing packages, introduce common good practices and highlight troubleshooting techniques.

Additionally, we will give a brief overview of how to develop a CMake package.

Practical examples will be demonstrated on [Cirrus](https://www.cirrus.ac.uk/) but will be applicable to other platforms.


This online session is open to all. It will use the Blackboard Collaborate platform.
