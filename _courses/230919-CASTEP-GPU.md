## Information about the course.

We are excited to announce a 'software spotlight' event across the MMM Hub, N8, and CSD3 Tier-2 consortia, 
to showcase a brand new release of the popular 'CASTEP' materials modelling package,
which now features significant GPU acceleration. 
We welcome Phil Hasnip from York, who will showcase the capabilities of the CASTEP 
package from a research perspective and will use live demonstrations to show how the 
code can be efficiently run in practice – in particular multinode and new GPU acceleration 
capabilities on the 'Young' HPC infrastructure. 

With demand for GPUs at historic highs (HPE leadtimes on new GPUs are at 52 weeks), we are very 
lucky to have access to the A100 GPUs on Young, with CSD3 and BEDE also offering GPUs, which provide 
large amounts of RAM and computing capacity. This talk will provide an opportunity for CASTEP users to 
switch from a CPU implementation to use these currently underused GPU resources.
